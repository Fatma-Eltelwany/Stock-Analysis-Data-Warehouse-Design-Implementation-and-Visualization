# Stock-Analysis-Data-Warehouse-Design-Implementation-and-Visualization

The aim of this project is to design, architect, and implement a data warehouse (DWH)
that stores stock market data effectively. The business requirement here is to evaluate
companiesâ€™ stock market performance to be considered a potential investment. Hence,
the DWH needs to accommodate historical data and relevant measures. The data stored
consist of various dimensions, attributes, and measures. The model shall be utilized to
make dashboards that tell a story about the data. The DWH model comprises five
dimension tables and two fact tables. The DWH is designed with generality in mind.
That is, it is possible to add companies from different industries, different stock markets,
or different countries. It is also possible to track data in atomic and aggregated forms
as our model offers both.
